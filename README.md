# TicTacToe
I have made this basic Tic Tac Toe game using java and xml. It is a fun game to play with friends. 
The Tic Tac Toe Game is based on a two-player game where each player chooses between X and O. Players play one move at a time simultaneously. 
In a move, a player can choose any position from a 3Ã—3 grid. The winner should have three consecutive X or O in horizontal,vertical or diagonal direction.
